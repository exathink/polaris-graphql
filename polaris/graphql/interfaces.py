        A named node extends the Relay Node interface with a UUID key

        The UUID key ensures instance ids are unique across types.
        The opaque (Relay) Node ID is derived from this 
        key, and can be used to access Nodes globally regardless of type using the Node query. 
        This ID is also used for client side data normalization and caching by Apollo.
